# Collecting environmental data with Raspberry Pi #

This repository contains instructions and programmes to interact with simple sensors designed for setting up "smart home" devices.

These have been tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B running Raspberry Pi OS 6.12.


## Getting Started  ##


### The Raspberry Pi ###


The Raspberry Pi is a mini computer. It was origionally created as an educational tool for getting students into computer science but has been a huge sucess in enabling a huge range of projects, from building cube satellites to hobbyist weather stations.


### Raspberry Pi Installation ###

This assumes that you have access to a Raspberry Pi with an operating system installed - these are availible from LabPlus.

If you have a brand new Raspberry Pi that needs the operating system installed, this is an easy process on the Raspberry Pi which you can follow (here)[https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/].


### The Linux Command Line ###

Some basic knowlage of the Linux command line is required to run the following tool. Don't be scared.

(Here)[docs/command_line.md] is a basic guide of the command line tools you
